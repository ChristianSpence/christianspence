### About me ðŸ‘‹

I'm an economist and data scientist with a passion for (and over 12 years experience in) public policy, particularly local government finance and devolution, industrial strategy and urban economic development, using data analytics and visualisation tools to improve the public understanding of economics and economic data and to support policy-making and evaluation.

I work in the Future Economies Research Centre at Manchester Metropolitan University where I'm head of economic data and analytics. We work on making economic data policy- and business-relevant, providing bespoke presentations, analyses and custom-built data tools for public and private sector organisations, and keep our work in the open whenever we can.

In September 2022 I'm joining [Open Innovations](www.open-innovations.org) as their Economic Data Lead.

If you're interested in what I do, get in touch: I'm always open to collaboration and knowledge sharing, as well as commercial research commissions.
