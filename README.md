### About me ðŸ‘‹

I'm an economist and data scientist working in the Future Economies Research Centre at Manchester Metropolitan University. I'm the head of Future Economies Analytics, a dedicated data-science and analytics research unit within the wider centre. We work on making economic data policy- and business-relevant, providing bespoke presentations, analyses and custom-built data tools for public and private sector organisations, and keep our work in the open whenever we can.

Most of my work will appear on the Future Economies Analytics github pages at github.com/FutureEconomiesAnalytics.

If you're interested in what we do, get in touch: we're always open to collaboration and knowledge sharing, as well as commerical research commissions.
