### About me ðŸ‘‹

I'm an economist and data scientist with a passion for (and over 13 years' experience in) public policy, particularly local government finance and devolution, industrial strategy and urban economic development, using data analytics and visualisation tools to improve the public understanding of economics and economic data and to support policy-making and evaluation.

I work on making economic data policy- and business-relevant, providing bespoke presentations, analyses and custom-built data tools for public and private sector organisations, keeping my work in the open whenever I can.

I've worked in local government, think tanks, business and academia and in September 2022 I joined [Open Innovations](https://open-innovations.org) ([GitHub](https://github.com/open-innovations)) as their Economic Data Lead, providing additional capability to their existing economics & productivity data practice, and supporting their Levelling Up and North England economic ambition themes.

I'm also Chief Economist and Fellow at the [Institute of Place Management](https://www.placemanagement.org/), and a Fellow at the [Royal Society of Arts](https://www.thersa.org/).

If you're interested in what I do, get in touch: I'm always open to collaboration and knowledge sharing, as well as commercial research commissions through my own consultancy, Economic Analytics.
